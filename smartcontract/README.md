# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Trigger
Before X: trigger is called before X happens.
After X: trigger is called after X happens.
For example, to update the status of an order object to "sold" when a particular NFT is transferred, you could define an afterSave trigger on EthNFTTransfers.
